### Step 3: Verify Sender Identity

SendGrid requires sender verification (free, no domain needed):

#### Option A: Single Sender Verification (Easiest - No Domain)

1. Go to: **Settings** → **Sender Authentication** → **Single Sender Verification**
2. Click **"Create New Sender"**
3. Fill in:
   ```
   From Name: Heedy
   From Email: muhammedminhaj798@gmail.com
   Reply To: muhammedminhaj798@gmail.com
   Company: Heedy
   Address: Your address
   City: Your city
   Country: India
   ```
4. Click **"Create"**
5. **Check your email** (muhammedminhaj798@gmail.com)
6. Click the verification link
7. ✅ Done! You can now send from this email

#### Option B: Domain Authentication (Professional - Requires Domain)

Only if you have a domain (heedy.com):
1. Go to: **Settings** → **Sender Authentication** → **Domain Authentication**
2. Add your domain
3. Add DNS records to your domain registrar
4. Wait for verification

---

### Step 4: Update .env File

Add these to your `.env`:

```env
# SendGrid Configuration (Production)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=muhammedminhaj798@gmail.com

# Nodemailer Configuration (Local Development)
SMTP_USER=muhammedminhaj798@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=bkjlocxukgqftnir
FROM_NAME=Heedy
```

---

### Step 5: Test Locally

```bash
node test-sendgrid.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ Email sent via SendGrid!
```

---

### Step 6: Deploy to Vercel/AWS

Add environment variables:

**Vercel:**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add:
   ```
   SENDGRID_API_KEY = SG.your_api_key_here
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL = muhammedminhaj798@gmail.com
   FROM_NAME = Heedy
   NODE_ENV = production
   ```

**AWS:**
Add to your environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager.
